I am a final year undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani, Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering with Hons. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Currently, I'm collaborating with [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) from [CSALT](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/csalt/), IIT-Bombay on the advancements of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for low-resource accented speeches. I've also worked with Senior [Prof. Ashwin Srinivasan](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/ashwin-srinivasan/), [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/), and [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.tcs.com/insights/authors/gautamshroff) at [APPCAIR](https://appcair.com/), where I studied the nature of LLMs in argumentative settings.

As a member of [SAiDL](https://www.saidl.in/), we actively contribute to fostering a spirit of ML and DL within the university. We aim to empower students with knowledge through [open-source projects](https://github.com/SforAiDl), research paper reading sessions, and personalized courses. My research interests span diverse areas, including NLP, Large Language Models, Speech Processing, CV, Representation Learning, Multimodality, etc. I like to explore other new areas of ML and DL a lot as well!
